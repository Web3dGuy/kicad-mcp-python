# Session Context - January 3, 2025

## Session Summary
This session focused on debugging and testing KiCad MCP schematic API functionality, specifically junction placement issues, fixing debug popups, and validating all schematic tools.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Junction API Debugging & Cleanup
- **Issue**: Junctions weren't appearing when placed via MCP API despite success responses
- **Investigation**: Deep dive into unit conversion, ownership handling, and commit methods
- **Resolution**: After extensive debugging, decided to stub out junction API for complete rebuild
- **Current State**: Junction creation disabled with TODO placeholder in `api_handler_sch.cpp`:
```cpp
if( anyItem.Is<schematic::types::Junction>() )
{
    // TODO: Implement junction creation - currently disabled
    // Junction API implementation needs to be rebuilt from scratch
    continue;
}
```

### 2. Debug Popup Fix
- **Issue**: Annoying popup messages appearing when creating schematic items
- **Root Cause**: `wxLogMessage` debug statements in CreateSchematicItems
- **Fix**: Removed all wxLogMessage calls from the API handler
- **Result**: Clean operation without debug popups

### 3. Save Function Fix  
- **Issue**: save_schematic reported "failed" despite actually saving successfully
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect response type handling (was None, should be Empty)
- **Fix**: Updated `schematicmodule.py` to use proper Empty protobuf response:
```python
if command_name == "SaveDocument":
    # SaveDocument returns Empty response type
    response = self.kicad._client.send(request, Empty)  
    return response
```
- **Result**: Save now correctly reports success

### 4. Comprehensive Tool Testing
- **Smart Routing**: Fully functional with Manhattan routing and obstacle avoidance
- **Wire Drawing**: Working correctly with automatic junction creation at intersections
- **Label Creation**: LocalLabel and GlobalLabel placement working
- **Delete Items**: Successfully tested bulk deletion with auto-cleanup (junctions removed with wires)
- **Save Schematic**: Fixed and validated

### 5. Important Discovery
- **Junction Auto-Deletion**: Confirmed that KiCad automatically removes junctions when connected wires are deleted
- **Native Junction Tool**: Fixed missing junction placement in native KiCad by restoring code from official repository

## Current Implementation Gaps (Placeholder Functions)

### 1. Junction Creation API
**Location**: `/Volumes/Vault/Workspace/kicad-development/kicad/eeschema/api/api_handler_sch.cpp`
**Status**: Stubbed out, needs complete rebuild
**Requirements**:
- Proper unit conversion (1 schematic IU = 100 nanometers)  
- Correct ownership handling with unique_ptr
- Integration with wire breaking for electrical connectivity
- Screen addition and commit handling

### 2. Unimplemented Schematic Item Types
**Location**: Same API handler file
**Missing Types** (based on EESCHEMA_MCP_FEATURE_CATALOG.md):
- Bus entries
- No-connect flags  
- Sheet hierarchies
- Text items (beyond labels)
- Power symbols
- Graphic shapes (lines, rectangles, circles)
- Images/bitmaps

### 3. Advanced Schematic Operations
**Not Yet Implemented**:
- Component property editing (values, references)
- Net naming and management
- Electrical Rules Check (ERC) integration
- Schematic annotation
- BOM generation
- Netlist export
- Symbol library management

### 4. Coordinate System Features
**Gaps**:
- Grid snapping API endpoints
- Coordinate transformation utilities
- Alignment tools
- Relative positioning helpers

## Next Session Priorities

### Priority 1: Rebuild Junction API
Start fresh implementation focusing on:
- Study official KiCad junction placement code
- Implement proper coordinate conversion
- Handle wire breaking correctly
- Test with various wire configurations

### Priority 2: Expand Item Type Support
Based on EESCHEMA_MCP_FEATURE_CATALOG.md Tier 1 items:
- No-connect flags (Low complexity)
- Bus entries (Medium complexity)  
- Power symbols (Medium complexity)

### Priority 3: Symbol Management
- GetSymbolProperties endpoint
- SetSymbolProperties endpoint
- Symbol rotation/mirroring

## Technical Notes for Next Session


### Test Project
- Location: `/Volumes/Vault/Workspace/kicad-development/mcp-test-project/`
- Current state: Battery (BT1) + 3 LEDs (D1, D2, D3) with no connections
- Ready for junction testing once API rebuilt

### Key File References
- API Handler: `kicad/eeschema/api/api_handler_sch.cpp`
- Protocol Definitions: `kicad/api/proto/schematic/schematic_commands.proto`
- Python Module: `kicad-mcp-python/kicad_mcp_python/schematic/schematicmodule.py`
- Feature Catalog: `EESCHEMA_MCP_FEATURE_CATALOG.md` (312+ operations mapped)

## Critical Reminders
1. Junction implementation needs complete rebuild - don't try to patch existing code
2. Smart routing is fully functional - previous "errors" were user error in tool usage
3. Save function is now fixed with proper Empty response type
4. Delete operations trigger automatic cleanup (junctions removed with wires)

## Session End State
- All schematic tools except junctions are functional
- Test schematic contains only bare components (BT1, D1, D2, D3)
- Ready for junction API rebuild in next session
- No active errors or issues requiring immediate attention
